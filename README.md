# Reed_Pipe_Enthusiast

Having been a reed pipe enthusiast for a long time now, your cousin cobbled together a little numerically
controlled machine that will enable him to carry out a serial production of reed pipes and make a business
out of it. However, he would like a software so that he can design his pipes himself. . .

So, you have to create a program for him that, starting from the pipe’s radius (in cm) with abscissas 0, 5, 10,
15 and 20 cm, and using cubic splines, displays the radii of n points that are evenly distributed along the
pipe. In order to simplify the debugging process, you will also display the resolved linear system’s vector result in order to obtain the spline.

Delivered AS IS.
